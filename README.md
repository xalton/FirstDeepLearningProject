# My First Deep learning project
This is my first deep learning project. I used a convolution neural network to build an image classification model.
Instead of repeating a dog/cat app, I collected images of Rick and Morty characters from the TV show https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rick_and_Morty by myself from multiple sources (videos, google search,...). 

## Packages
I used the folowing python packages to run the code:
* os
* time
* numpy
* pandas
* tensorflow and keras
* tkinter and ttk

## Running the tests

## Graphical interface
--In progress--
